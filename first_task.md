# Task 1

## Define the data types

```
departments = ["CS", "IT", "ECE"]  # List for departments
blocked_sites = {"example.com", "test.com"}  # Set for unique blocked websites
student_data = {"name": "John", "college_name": "CollegeA"} 

```

-  The `department` i make the list because list is used to store multiple value and allow duplication. It is mutable so if i add the item in the future i easily use the this so i use the list method to store the departments.

- `blocked_sites` : I  make the blocked_sites because set is used to store unique values and it is faster to retrieve the data.

- `student_data` : I make the student data in the dictionary format because dictionary is used to store data in `key-value pairs` and provide the structured way to store the data.

### Output:

- I use the this i learn about how to give the proper data type that is provide best result.
